# PRD: Agentic Search Demo

## Overview

A Python project demonstrating how to convert a conventional keyword search function into an agentic search function, evaluated against the Wayfair WANDS dataset using NDCG.

## Goals

- Show a clear, concrete before/after: plain search vs. agentic search
- Both implementations share the same external API so they can be evaluated identically
- Keep things simple and readable — this is a demo/teaching artifact

## Dataset

**WANDS** (Wayfair ANnotated Dataset for Search)
- Product catalog with titles, descriptions, and categories
- Queries with human relevance judgments (Exact / Partial / Irrelevant)
- Pulled down as part of project setup (not committed to the repo)

## Architecture

### Search API (shared interface)

Both the normal search and the agentic search conform to the same interface:

- **Input:** a keyword query string
- **Output:** an ordered list of search results (product ID + score or rank)

This shared interface is the key design constraint — it allows both implementations to plug into the same NDCG evaluation harness.

### 1. Normal Search

A conventional BM25-based keyword search over the WANDS product catalog.

- Indexes product fields (title, description, category)
- Takes a keyword query, returns ranked results
- Serves as the baseline and also as a tool for the agent

### 2. Agentic Search

Wraps the normal search behind an LLM agent loop.

- Externally: same API as normal search (keyword in, ranked results out)
- Internally:
  - The agent receives the original query
  - Has access to a tool that wraps the normal search function
  - Runs an agentic loop: issues keyword searches, inspects results, refines queries
  - Synthesizes a final ranked result list from what it finds
- The agent is free to issue multiple searches, rewrite queries, filter, rerank, etc.

### 3. NDCG Evaluation Harness

- Loads WANDS queries and relevance judgments
- Runs a search function (normal or agentic) against each query
- Computes NDCG@k for each query, reports mean NDCG across the query set
- Accepts any callable that matches the search API interface

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python
- **Package / env management:** UV
- **Search:** BM25 (likely via `searcharray` or similar)
- **Agent:** Claude API (Anthropic SDK) or OpenAI — TBD
- **Evaluation:** NDCG computed from WANDS relevance judgments

## Success Criteria

- Normal search baseline NDCG established on WANDS
- Agentic search measurably improves NDCG over baseline
- Both plug into the same eval harness with no code changes to the harness
- Code is clean enough to use as a teaching/demo artifact

## Still to do
- create a new branch that does more complex search that has inputs of name, description, and category

# Talk outline
- State Goals (below) and big lessons 1) it's (probably) easy to wrap a search API in an agent and get better results 2) but you need to have evals to make sure you're moving in the right direction
- Pieces
  – we have a search API over WANDS dataset. keyword in, product id's out
  - we have an NDGC evaluator that looks at the labeled "truth" items and provides a score
  - we also have a nice tool that pretty prints out agent traces - useful for debugging and updating agent
- Build an agent
  - it uses the search api as a tool
  - it returns a nice presentation of the search results
  - it has a simple system message
  - IMPORTANT - it logs out the 
- Evaluation explanation (while John is waiting for Claude Code to build agent)
  - What is NDGC
  - Run NDGC against plain search
  - Run NDGC against agent search
  - Compare
- Fix any problems by reviewing the traces.
- If extra time, then repeat the above with "hard mode" where we introduce fields and query syntax (better demo for the eval-optimize loop - but also might not optimize well)
- Talk about how we can Ralph it - create an automated outer loop powered by claude code that does all this stuff for us
